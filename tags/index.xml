Am I color blind ? I&amp;rsquo;m not sure. But 1 thing I&amp;rsquo;m certain is that I&amp;rsquo;m unable to read some of those pictures with dots in different colors (aka ishihara test). Instead of getting a letter from ophthalmologist/optometrist to prove that I&amp;rsquo;m a color blind but still safe to drive on the road. I chose to study on ishihara test.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You might wonder how ? Color Filter on windows !&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I started to spot the patterns of the ishihara test and I can get all of them right all the time without much hassel. Hence, I&amp;rsquo;m quite confident with the upcoming color blind test and rest of the test. I will update again once I passed or the worst case I fail and have the need to consult a ophthalmologist/optometrist.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Struggle</title><link>https://huveewomg.github.io/blog/struggle/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 May 2022 20:43:49 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://huveewomg.github.io/blog/struggle/</guid><description>&lt;p>
If you're reading this article there is a good chance I successfully deploy this site on github pages without using alternative method such as netlify or anything similar.
&lt;p>Update : After 5 days of procastination I finally manage to deploy this site. 30/5&lt;/p>
&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Why I Made This Site</title><link>https://huveewomg.github.io/blog/why-i-made-this-site/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 May 2022 22:08:27 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://huveewomg.github.io/blog/why-i-made-this-site/</guid><description>&lt;h1> Here Is Why &lt;/h1>

During the journey of learning language I met a nice person who is a web devs and he inspired me to try out something new.
&lt;p>Making a website has always been one of them. I spent hours a year ago to learn the basic of markup languages yet didnt make anything with it. I procastinated a lot even though I have all the time in the word at the moment. Yesterday, I challenged myself to sit down and spend a day and do it and this is the end result.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Frankly speaking I&amp;rsquo;m quite proud of how things turns out.
Despite the fact I forgot most of the syntax but is painless to get back to them. Thank you my friend !&lt;/p>
