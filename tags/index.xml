Is been awhile since the last time I write a post here and I'm quite free at the moment so I decided to write something. 3-4 months ago I enrolled for a university studying Software Engineering but to my suprise I spent the entire first semester studying nothing related to it. Ended up spending my time on game and automating task.
&lt;p>I wish you a early Merry Christmas and Happy new year !
早めのメリクリ、あけおめ！来年もよろしくお願いします。&lt;/p>

If you're reading this article there is a good chance I successfully deploy this site on github pages without using alternative method such as netlify or anything similar.
&lt;p>Update : After 5 days of procastination I finally manage to deploy this site. 30/5&lt;/p>

During the journey of learning language I met a nice person who is a web devs and he inspired me to try out something new.
&lt;p>Making a website has always been one of them. I spent hours a year ago to learn the basic of markup languages yet didnt make anything with it. I procastinated a lot even though I have all the time in the word at the moment. Yesterday, I challenged myself to sit down and spend a day and do it and this is the end result.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Frankly speaking I&amp;rsquo;m quite proud of how things turns out.
Despite the fact I forgot most of the syntax but is painless to get back to them. Thank you my friend !&lt;/p>
