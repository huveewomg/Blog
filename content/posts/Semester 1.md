Is been awhile since the last time I write a post here and I'm quite free at the moment so I decided to write something. 3-4 months ago I enrolled for a university studying Software Engineering but to my suprise I spent the entire first semester studying nothing related to it. Ended up spending my time on game and automating task. 

I wish you a early Merry Christmas and Happy new year ! 
早めのメリクリ、あけおめ！来年もよろしくお願いします。
