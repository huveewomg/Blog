Recently, I enrolled for driving class and the only thing I fear is the color blind test. Am I color blind ? I'm not sure. But 1 thing I'm certain is that I'm unable to read some of those pictures with dots in different colors (aka ishihara test). Instead of getting a letter from ophthalmologist/optometrist to prove that I'm a color blind but still safe to drive on the road. I chose to study on ishihara test. 

You might wonder how ? Color Filter on windows !

I started to spot the patterns of the ishihara test and I can get all of them right all the time without much hassel. Hence, I'm quite confident with the upcoming color blind test and rest of the test. I will update again once I passed or the worst case I fail and have the need to consult a ophthalmologist/optometrist.
