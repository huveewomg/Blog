Greeting Again,

It was a quick 4 months a lot happened. Working hard and also gaming hard this semester. Spending countless hours on Project Zomboid and currently Modded Minecraft. Even capable of finishing a TV series during my 2 weeks break. Proudest achievement this semester has to be finishing Nier:Replicant ending A/B/C/D. I will do my best to finish the E ending as well because I'm really not good at playing singleplayer video game if you know me well.

1 important lesson I learned this semester is that rely on AI more. It was not worth the trouble to work until late night to come up with a clean code because not a single soul will value your work. If you are interest to check out what hot mess I wrote is right <a href="https://github.com/huveewomg/PWP-Assignment">here</a>. Frankly speaking, I can't recall most of the stuff happened this semester.

See you in 4 months. Hopefully I done something by then.

Update (28/10): Do expect for a remake for this entire website. I'm thinking to integrate some API like LastFM on here if I have the time.
