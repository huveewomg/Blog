<p>
Is been awhile since I last update anything here, It was an eventful semester. Learned quite a lot on how to be a developer and spent an unholy amount of time infront of my monitor. On the previous post, I said that I will remake this page into something more interesting. I'm afraid I'll have to postpone that idea and work on other aspect in my life. On a side note, I think I'm biting off more than I can chew right now with all the upcoming events in April while trying to learn plenty of different stuff. Such as: React, Laravel, Ruby on Rails, and Java.

Hopefully I return with some good news in 4 months!
So long.
