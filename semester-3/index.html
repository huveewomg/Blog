Working hard and also gaming hard this semester. Spending countless hours on Project Zomboid and currently Modded Minecraft. Even capable of finishing a TV series during my 2 weeks break. Proudest achievement this semester has to be finishing Nier:Replicant ending A/B/C/D. I will do my best to finish the E ending as well because I&rsquo;m really not good at playing singleplayer video game if you know me well.</p><p>1 important lesson I learned this semester is that rely on AI more. It was not worth the trouble to work until late night to come up with a clean code because not a single soul will value your work. If you are interest to check out what hot mess I wrote is right <a href=https://github.com/huveewomg/PWP-Assignment>here</a>. Frankly speaking, I can&rsquo;t recall most of the stuff happened this semester.</p><p>See you in 4 months. Hopefully I done something by then.</p><p>Update (28/10): Do expect for a remake for this entire website. I&rsquo;m thinking to integrate some API like LastFM on here if I have the time.</p></p></article></main><footer id=footer></footer></body></html>
