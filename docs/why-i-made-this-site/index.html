<p>
During the journey of learning language I met a nice person who is a web devs and he inspired me to try out something new. 
<p>Making a website has always been one of them. I spent hours a year ago to learn the basic of markup languages yet didnt make anything with it. I procastinated a lot even though I have all the time in the word at the moment. Yesterday, I challenged myself to sit down and spend a day and do it and this is the end result.</p>
<p>Frankly speaking I&rsquo;m quite proud of how things turns out.
Despite the fact I forgot most of the syntax but is painless to get back to them. Thank you my friend !</p>
