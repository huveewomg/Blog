Semester 2 was by far the worst one I have had in a while. Working with more than 14 passive people in a group over the course of 12 weeks has taken quite a toll on me. Other than that, everything else went smoothly, and I visited more places than I did last year. I had planned to visit the infamous cult, but unfortunately, the cult members are too lazy to even raise funds to revive their leaders. At the same time, I managed to meet more people from around the world. Hopefully, semester 3 will treat me nicely.<p>See you in another 4 months~</p></p></article></main><footer id=footer></footer></body></html>
